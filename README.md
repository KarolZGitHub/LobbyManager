# LobbyManager
It is an application that helps players to find people willing to play at the same level. For creating a project I have used Java, WebSocket, Java Script, Spring Boot, Spring, Hibernate.
Inside a game room players may have a chat, and in each room most viewed stream featuring room's game from twitch.tv is live displayed, I have used twitch API to check and show the most viewed stream.
Whenever player searches for a game his search is saved in database, when another player creates room of specified game and rank, user who's search  was saved will recive e-mail about created room.
This application contains possibility to create casual users and admin accounts, admin can send directly e-mail for each user.
